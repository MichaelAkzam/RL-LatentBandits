# hmm-bandits
Code for "Linearizing Contextual Bandits with Latent State Dynamics."

The bandit task/environment can be selected or modified in main.py
The L2TS and L2UCB algorithms are implemented in algorithm.py
(The linear TS baseline which uses the raw context data is implemented in linear_bandit.py)
